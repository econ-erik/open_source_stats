# open_source_stats
Coding examples using open source coding platforms
I plan to upload useful code snippets for working with data in open source platforms (mainly Rstats).
So far: 
1) An example from mountainmath from a CABE presentation he gave on cansim in R 
2) a snippet showing how you can read in the state-level UI claims from the DOL weekly PDF file
